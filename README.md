# Data Engineering Hack Box

A few times a year we do little hack sessions to try to pick up new skills and try something new. Sometimes the work will be very exploratory, and sometimes it will have a fixed purpose. For exploratory work, we work individually but share our experience at the end of the day. In this circumstance, you can find our contributions under `<hack-theme>/<first-name>` e.g. `faust-scraper/joel`.

We also encourage adding general purpose documentation to `<hack-theme>/README.md` e.g. `faust-scraper/README.md`.
